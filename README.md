# namconade.neocities.org.V1
Version 1 of my old Neocities website.

You'll notice the code is. Not good. Well, it was the first html website I made before I got any real classes on how to code. I tried teaching myself a bit of HTML before College started, so I tried learning from other websites and from simple sources. To familiarize myself with HTML and CSS. 

Don't worry about the visual style, it was made intentionally to have this tacky old website look. Don't worry about it aye don't think about it too hard.

I think it's worth keeping, at least to me. It's a way for me to look back at what I made in the past, and see how much I've improved. I don't want it to get lost to time...

This website was made in August of 2019, revamped a bit in December 2020, and seems like I updated it in 2022 to add a message to it. Been a while.
